# UNI
This repository is basically where I stash all my uni stuff - assignments, lessons, the whole deal. It's super convenient because I can get to it from anywhere with internet access, which is a lifesaver. Plus, my uni friends use it too, so it's like our go-to spot for sharing study materials, or maybe even a little help during exams ðŸ˜‰
